# react-typescript-template

A simple starting point for any react-typescript project, without all the bloat of CRA.

# Getting started

(I suggest cloning with `npx degit Danglebary/react-typescript-template` as it removes the `.git` directory of this repo, letting you begin your project, only using this repo as a starting point. This method requires a global installation of `degit`, which can be installed with `npm i -g degit`)

-   First, run `yarn` to install necessary dependencies.
-   Then, run `yarn dev` to run the app in development mode with hot-reloading enabled.
